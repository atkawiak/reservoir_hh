# Rigorous Reservoir Experiment Configuration
# Based on Multi-Agent Brainstorming Design Review

experiment:
  name: "Edge of Chaos Verification"
  version: "1.0"

# Network sizes to test
sizes: [100]  # TEST MODE: Only N=100

# Number of different random seeds per size
seeds_per_size: 30

# Which benchmarks to run
benchmarks:
  - MC
  - NARMA10

# Calibration settings
calibration:
  # Coarse sweep to find approximate Edge
  coarse_sweep: [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 5.0, 10.0]
  
  # Use brentq to refine Edge location after coarse sweep
  fine_search: true
  fine_search_tolerance: 0.05
  
  # Measure Lambda multiple times and take median (reduces noise)
  lambda_repetitions: 3
  lambda_steps: 1000  # Steps per measurement

# Validation gates - reject reservoirs that don't meet criteria
validation:
  # Edge must have Lambda in this range
  edge_lambda_range: [-0.2, 0.2]
  
  # Stable must have Lambda in this range
  stable_lambda_range: [-0.5, -0.05]
  
  # Minimum MC to consider reservoir "alive"
  min_mc_alive: 0.01

# Benchmark settings
benchmark_settings:
  mc_samples: 1000
  mc_max_lag: 30
  narma_length: 1000
  benchmark_repetitions: 1  # Run each benchmark N times

# Parallelization
parallelization:
  max_workers_fraction: 0.9  # Use 90% of CPU cores

# Output
output:
  results_file: "EXPERIMENT_RESULTS_N100.csv"
  summary_file: "EXPERIMENT_SUMMARY_N100.csv"
