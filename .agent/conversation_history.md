### USER Objective:
Debugging Chaos Search
The user's primary goal is to reliably generate chaotic network states for their research. They aim to understand why their current methods fail to produce chaotic states, explore alternative strategies for generating these states (e.g., by adjusting parameters like `gA`, `rho`, or firing rate thresholds), and ultimately implement and test a revised approach to reliably generate stable, edge, and chaotic network states for their triplet ensembles.
